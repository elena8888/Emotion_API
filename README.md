# Microsoft Cognitive Services:Emotion_API

This Jupyter notebook is the example I used to accompany my post on [datarambler.com](http://www.datarambler.com/ai-is-coming-analyzing-game-of-thrones-with-the-microsoft-emotion-api/)

I demonstrate how to analyze a video clip for facial emotions using the Emotion API from Microsoft in Python. In the future I hope to post more examples covering the entire Microsoft Cognitive Services suite
